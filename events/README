Make sure the conntrack kernel module is installed (if it isn't built into the kernel):

   modprobe ip_conntrack

If you have the conntrack tools installed you should be able to watch conntrack events with

   conntrack -E

The code in this directory is based entirely off an example program from:

Note this does require linking with a GPL licensed library so this code has to be GPL licensed as well.
